# For Loops

To run a block of code repeatedly in a loop, use the `loop` keyword

Here are some examples:

```
loop {
	next; // skip remainder of current iteration and go directly to next
	done; // we're done with this loop
}
```

## Control

To end the current iteration and go to the next, `next` (similar to `continue` in other langs).

To end the entire loop, `done` (similar to `break` in other langs).
